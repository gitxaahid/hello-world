# maven-project

This is a simple maven project I tried to deploy project by Git, Jenkins, and Tomcat server First, we pull the code from the GitHub repository, build it through maven, and deploy it onto the Tomcat server. When this project is deployed I use the Poll SCM technique to maintain CI it's a cronjob type of thing whenever any changes happen in the Source code it builds the code automatically and does the changes whatever the developer wants.
